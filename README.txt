This is repo for my Learn Ruby the Hard Way examples.

I will be posting each example as I work through them everyday.

The goal is to have at least a commit a day to keep the skills sharp

and allow me to become even more comfortable with the command line,

git and distributed version control in general.

There will be notes in each example.
